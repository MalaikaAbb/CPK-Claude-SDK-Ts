# Components as Tools

> Let your agent render rich React components directly in the chat by calling them as tools.


<!-- interactive demo: gen-ui-tool-based -->


## What is this?

Tool-based Generative UI is the simplest form of Generative UI: you register
a React component with `useComponent`, and CopilotKit exposes it to the
agent as a tool. When the agent calls the tool, CopilotKit renders your
component inline in the chat, passing the tool's arguments straight through
as typed props.

Unlike [tool rendering](/claude-sdk-typescript/generative-ui/tool-rendering), which wraps a
real backend tool in a custom UI, tool-based GenUI is the component. There
is no handler, no user interaction, no server-side execution. The agent
decides when to show it, populates the data, and CopilotKit paints it.

## When should I use this?

Use `useComponent` when you want to:

- Display rich UI (cards, charts, tables, dashboards) inline in the chat
- Show structured data the agent has derived from its reasoning
- Render previews, status indicators, or visual summaries
- Let the agent present information beyond plain text

For components that need user interaction, see
[Human-in-the-loop](/claude-sdk-typescript/human-in-the-loop). For operational transparency
around a real backend tool, see [Tool rendering](/claude-sdk-typescript/generative-ui/tool-rendering).

## How it works in code

<Steps>

    ### Forward browser tools to Claude

    Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` arrive in the AG-UI run
    input. Convert each AG-UI tool definition into an Anthropic Messages API
    tool schema before calling the model. Runs that carry frontend tools use
    the direct Messages API path rather than the Claude Agent SDK.

    
~~~~typescript title="agent_server.ts"
function buildTools(tools: RunAgentInput["tools"]): Anthropic.Tool[] {
  if (!tools || tools.length === 0) return [];

  return tools.map((tool) => {
    let inputSchema: Anthropic.Tool.InputSchema = {
      type: "object",
      properties: {},
    };
    if (tool.parameters) {
      try {
        const parsed =
          typeof tool.parameters === "string"
            ? JSON.parse(tool.parameters)
            : tool.parameters;
        inputSchema = parsed as Anthropic.Tool.InputSchema;
      } catch (parseErr) {
        // Don't silently swap in an empty schema — Claude will then accept
        // any input shape, which compounds whatever caller bug produced
        // the malformed JSON. Warn loudly so the tool definition gets
        // fixed instead of being papered over.
        const message =
          parseErr instanceof Error ? parseErr.message : String(parseErr);
        console.warn(
          `[agent_server] failed to parse tool.parameters for ${tool.name}; using empty schema. error=${message}`,
        );
      }
    }
// [!code highlight:5]
    return {
      name: tool.name,
      description: tool.description ?? "",
      input_schema: inputSchema,
    };
  });
}
~~~~

  </Step>
</Steps>

Import the React hook and Zod in the component that registers the tool. This also
applies to the built-in agent, which needs no backend tool-registration step.

```tsx
import { useComponent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { z } from "zod";
```

`useComponent` takes a name, a Zod schema for its props, and the component
to render. The runtime registers it as a frontend tool so the agent can
discover it, and the schema becomes that tool's parameter definition — it is
what tells the model which arguments to send.

<Callout type="warn">
  `parameters` is optional, but leaving it out advertises the tool with an
  empty parameter schema (`{ "type": "object", "properties": {} }`). The model
  then has nothing to fill in, so it calls the tool with no arguments and your
  component renders with no props. Pass a schema for any component that needs
  data.
</Callout>

```typescript
// src/app/demos/gen-ui-tool-based/page.tsx
  useComponent({
    name: "render_bar_chart",
    description: "Display a bar chart with labeled numeric values.",
    parameters: barChartPropsSchema,
    render: BarChart,
  });
```

The component itself is ordinary React: it reads only its props and can
stream in as the agent fills the payload. The example above uses
[Recharts](https://recharts.org) for the bar chart; it doesn't know
anything about CopilotKit.

<Callout type="info">
  The `name` you pass to `useComponent` is what the agent sees as the tool
  name. Make it a verb like `render_bar_chart` or `show_weather` so the LLM
  reliably picks it when the user asks for that visualization.
</Callout>

## Rendering in a headless chat

CopilotKit's built-in chat components paint registered components for you. A
headless or custom chat renders the message list itself, so nothing paints a
tool call unless you render it — the component is registered and the agent
calls it, but the chat stays empty.

Render the tool calls on each assistant message with
`CopilotChatToolCallsView`:

```tsx
import { CopilotChatToolCallsView } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

<CopilotChatToolCallsView message={assistantMessage} messages={allMessages} />;
```

It looks up the sibling `tool`-role message for each tool call and hands both
to the registered renderer. For finer placement, call `useRenderToolCall()` and
paint each tool call yourself — see
[Headless UI](/claude-sdk-typescript/custom-look-and-feel/headless-ui).
