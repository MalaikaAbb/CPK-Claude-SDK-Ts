# Doc drift changelog

What the CopilotKit docs changed under this repo, written by the sync on
`/doc-sync`. Only pages that actually moved are recorded — a sync that finds
everything unchanged writes nothing here at all.

Holds the 3 most recent dated entries. When a change lands on a fourth
date, the oldest entry is dropped. Entries are counted, not aged, so a gap of
weeks between changes does not expire anything.

**High — Agent Config**

- ## How it works
- The runtime owns the agent in-process, so config travels through frontend
- runtime properties rather than agent state. There's no separate backend service
- to push state into: the typed object becomes the input to the agent factory

**High — A2UI · Fixed Schema**

- renderer props are typed as their resolved values (plain `z.string()`,
- not a path-or-literal union).
+ your renderer receives the resolved value and never sees the path — but
+ the *definition* still has to declare that prop as a literal-or-binding
+ union, because that union is the only signal the binder has that the
+ prop is bindable. See [Declare the component
+ definitions](#declare-the-component-definitions).

- For the Google ADK showcase, agent runs take one more hop: this Next.js route registers the `voice-demo` agent with an `HttpAgent` pointed at `${AGENT_URL}/voice`. The Python `agent_server.py` mounts registered ADK agents with `add_adk_fastapi_endpoint(app, ..., path=f"/{agent_name}")`, so the browser talks to `/api/copilotkit-voice` while the Next.js runtime forwards voice-demo agent runs to the backend `/voice` endpoint.
